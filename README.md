# Community Detection via Graph Optimization Methods based on Modularity and Balanced Cuts

Optimization project that tackles the problem of community detection through: 

- a *Modularity* based approach 
- a *Graph Cut* based approach 

applied on the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network dataset, and other 3 from SNAP [0].

The first optimization problem was faced with the usage of the *FAST-ATVO algorithm* [1], a software for community detection in undirected graphs
with non-negative weights.. The second one was addressed through *Radio DCA* [2] and *Fista* [3].
